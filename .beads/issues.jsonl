The buffer should:\n\n- Display tickets in a clean, organized format\n- Show key ticket information (ID, title, priority, type)\n- Support interactive actions (view details, claim ticket, etc.)\n- Use transient.el for the UI like magit does\n- Refresh on demand\n- Integrate with existing emacs-beads infrastructure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-01T08:03:47.611557+13:00","updated_at":"2025-11-01T17:15:46.812879+13:00","closed_at":"2025-11-01T17:15:46.812879+13:00"}

Data layer: bd list --json parsing to alist representation\n2. Presentation layer: completing-read formatter (priority, type, title), marginalia formatter (labels), magit-section buffer renderer\n3.

This will make beads-issue.el a better place for shared issue data structures and parsing logic that can be reused by beads-show and other modules.","design":"1.
