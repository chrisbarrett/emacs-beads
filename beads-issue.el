;;; beads-issue.el --- Buffer-based input for creating bd issues -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a git-commit-like buffer interface for creating
;; beads (bd) issues. Users can type free-form text describing the issue,
;; and an AI agent interprets the text into structured issue data.
;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'ring)
(require 'beads-process)
(require 'beads-agent)

;;; Customization
